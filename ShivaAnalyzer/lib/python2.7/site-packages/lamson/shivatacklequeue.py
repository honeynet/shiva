Shiva - This module deals with analysis of spam retrived from queue (queuePath)
The decision whether to relay mail or not is taken here and it's sub-modules

The variable msgMailRequest has been passed to all subsequent modules and functions. None of other module needs it but
process_message function needs this value. Could not find a direct way to assign this value to process_message, hence
the same value has been circulated throughout all modules/functions and ultimately it reaches process_message
